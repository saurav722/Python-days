#relational operator
x = 5

print(x == y)

# returns False because 5 is not equal to 3

#identity operator

print(x is z)

# returns True because z is the same object as x

print(x is y)

# returns False because x is not the same object as y, even if they have the same content

print(x == y)

# to demonstrate the difference betweeen "is" and "==": this comparison returns True because x is equal to y
